## Introduction

### What is Terminal ?

A **terminal** is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with their computer using commands. It provides a way to input text commands and receive text-based output. Terminals are powerful tools for users who prefer command-line interactions over graphical user interfaces (GUI).

### What is a Shell ?

The **shell** is a program that interprets and executes user commands. It acts as an interface between the user and the operating system. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular shell that comes pre-installed on most Unix-based systems, including Linux and macOS. It provides a set of commands and features to navigate the file system, manage processes and automate tasks.

## Terminal Navigation with Bash

These are the essential commands for navigating the terminal with Bash. Let's explore the key commands :

### pwd (Print Working Directory)

The `pwd` command prints the current working directory. It's handy for quickly checking where you are in the file system.

### cd (Change Directory)

Use the `cd` command to change to a different directory. For instance, entering `cd ~` takes you to your home directory.

### pushd and popd

- **pushd:** Adds the current directory to a stack.
- **popd:** Removes the top directory from the stack, making it the current directory. This is useful for easy navigation between directories.

### File System Navigation Notations

- Use `.` for the current directory.
- Use `..` for the parent directory.
